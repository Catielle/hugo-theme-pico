This theme aims to be minimalist, readable, responsive, light and beautiful. Inspired by **Medium** and **The New York Times**, Pico try to provide the best experience for the reader while having an awesome design. It can be configured as a single page, or as a full-featured site with multiple sections. It is multilingual, responsive, and includes a light and *dark theme* (*soon*).

You can check the [**example site**](https://sponge-bob.netlify.app/).
